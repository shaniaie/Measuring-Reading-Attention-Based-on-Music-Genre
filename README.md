# COGS189-Final-Project

The participant will sit down at a table and we will give them these instructions:
You will be reading two different narrative forms (Fiction vs. Non-Fiction) with 3 different passages. 
You will read each passage with a different genre of music:
  - Lofi
  - EDM
  - Pop

You will be given a Pre-Survey that will assess how confident you are with your reading speed with accuracy in the experiment for the Fiction (Lo-fi, EDM, and Pop) and Non-Fiction (Lo-fi, EDM, and Pop) categories on a scale of 1(Not confident) - 10 (Very confident).
PRE-SURVEY LINK
You will first listen to the song for 30 seconds, then start reading the passage for 1 minute.
The observer will circle any words you mess up on or do not know
After completing the experiment, you will complete a Post-Survey where you will  be assessed on how much each song helped with you focus and concentration in the experiment for Fiction (Lo-fi, EDM, and Pop) and Non-Fiction (Lo-fi, EDM, and Pop) categories on a scale of 1(Not focused) - 10 (Very focused). You will also be asked to rate each song from 1(Dislike) - 10(Like)
POST-SURVEY LINK
As data recorders, we will monitor the music and also circle what they mess upon or what they get incorrect (Incorrectness is judged based on pronunciation and how long it takes for the participant to speak)
We will gather the total words they got correctly out of the passage.
